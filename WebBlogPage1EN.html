        <h3> Basic knowledge about making pages with Html and Css</h3>
        <h4> Written and made by: Andreas Phillip Krogrud. </h4>
        <em><h6> NB: All tags should be inn <(tag)> </h6></em>
        <p>To begin with HTML and CSS is very easy. You may only have a computer and a notepad. HTML is a very easy programing language compared to other languages. This is because the html uses something called tags. Here are some examples: "p" This is a tag that opens "/ p" And this is a tag that closes, exactly this tag in the example is a paragraph tag. That is what you write so you can write a paragraph. There are many different tags. One also have tags to have other tags in. So within a paragraph you can make parts of the paragraph a link a href="#" and /a  inside the tag you can write anything to make it into a link. For example: a href="https://google.com/" google /a if you add all this in the middle of a paragraph so it can say. here is a link to google. and if you click on "google" in the text you're going to google simply. And it must not necessarily  be "google" to work.  It can say exactly what you want. This is why html is so easy to learn and easy to use. CSS is a little more advanced but still quite simple. There is just more to remember, but once you get the hang of it you can create websites that look like a pro has made it and that it must have cost a lot of money and a lot of time, but it's easy and free. It may take time but with a little patience one can create something to be proud of.

        <p> Here is a list of tags that you probably want to write down somewhere. I have written alot of tags and a description of what they are. </p>
        <p> ! DOCTYPE html - This allows it to always look the same on all computers. This does not need any more simply have it before anything else. </p>
        <p> html /html - This is used to have all the code built in. The whole code should always be inside this tag. </p>
        <p> head /head - Within this tag you can have info that should not be displayed on the screen but the program needs. As title, stylesheet (this we will talk about later.) And other things that the program may need to make it work properly. </p>
        <p> body / body - This is where you write what will appear on screen. here you write headlines, text, images, links and other things you want to have on screen. </p>
        <p> div class = "#" / div - div is a way to organize your code. and can be used in many ways with CSS later. </p>
        <p> h # /h # - This is a header. There are a different text that is good for headlines or captions "#" must be replaced with a number from 1 to 6 so where h1 is the largest and h6 is the smallest and less than a normal paragraph. These can be used in many cool ways in css as we shall learn later. </p>
        <p> p /p - This is a standard paragraph that you can add a text. This is most often the main font on your site.</p>
        <p> a href = "#" / a - this makes everything inside the tag to a link. "#" Must be replaced with a full link not only "google.com" but "https://google.com/" if you are gonna use google. The link may also not only be a text, but almost anything that you put inside it. This can also be a file placement if you have another page you want to open. </p>
        <p> "Img src =" # "/" - this is something called a self-closing tag. This means that you do not need a closing tag since you will not have anything in between anyway so you just add closing the signal "/" at the end. "#" Must be replaced with a link or a file placement. </p>
        <p> ul / ul and ol / ol - these are the two list types. ul is a list that is not arranged by numbers ol this is nubered. So you can make a list of your favorite meal with ol and a list of things you must do with ul. </p>
        <p> li /li - Use this inside the list to create more items on the list. </p>
