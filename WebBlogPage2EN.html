        <h3>Css in web page development</h3>
        <h4> Written and made by: Andreas Phillip Krogrud. </h4>
        <p>CSS is the second programming language that you probably want to use to create very cool websites. Making a website is not very difficult, but Css requires the most effort. The reason for this is since you use HTML to create the website itself, but Css get it to look very good. Most sites use CSS or something similar. CSS has a lot more potential than html only page, html almost can not choose how things should be but combined with CSS you can create backgrounds, resize images, change color font etc. CSS can look more like regular scripting if you know how to script, but not completely. With Css do you make a ".css" file. In this file, you can select an item in your HTML code and change it. To use a .css code in your website add a head tag and inside head tag add "(link type =" text / css "rel =" # "href =" #. Css "/)"  # is the filename on the Css file. Inside the Css you only need to write: # {} inside {(here)} you can write what you want to change. # Is the name of the item. If you want to select a class int the Css file add a "." in front of #.
</p>
        <p> Here is a list of popular things you can change. If you want something different that you can apply on web pages then these are only some examples there are many others things.
 </p>
        <p> color: #; - Changes color of the text # should be replaced with a color in English.
 </p>
        <p> font-size: #px; - This is the font size as measured in pixels replace # with a number.
 </p>
        <p> text-align: #; - This is on what side of the screen the text should be "left" "center" or "right" replace one of those out with #.
</p>

 </p>
