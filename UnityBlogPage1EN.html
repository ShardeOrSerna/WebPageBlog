        <h3>Unity</h3>

        <p>Unity 5 is an engine that you use to create games. Unity 5 comes with MonoDevelop that allows you to write scripts with languages like C #, Boo and javascript.boo Unity has its own language but no one uses it. C # is the one that is used most. while JavaScript is used it is not as popular as C #.
</p>
        <p> In Unity you can create games for mobile, pc, web and many other platforms in 3D and 2D.</p>

        <p> Unity is free, but if you want then you can buy the pro version to help you with many things. Like licence and stuff.</p>
 <h3> Unity 5 </h3>
        <p> There are quite a few tutorials for unity 5 the most part on c # but you can find someone who is JavaScript, but boo no need to learn it so you can forget it.</p>
        <p>Andreas and I have created a few games with unity 5 (you can find many projects with names like “test1,test2” etc.) I have also created games on mobile so if you want to do it so can you.</p>
        <p>Well there is not any much more with unity 5.So what I wanted to say is that you should use unity 5 for creating games or you can use Unreal Engine but I don’t know anything about it.</p>
